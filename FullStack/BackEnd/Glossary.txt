static vs shared libraries
- static libraries is static copied code : lib
- shared libraries is dynamic linking : dll, dylib
-- most dependencies are shared libraries! -> to enable sharing and wastefull minimise on prem copies
--- dependency hell is real, direct importing of a lot of libraries can cause it
---- unlike regular installers, package managers try and solve this versioning issue
----- tools like npm and maven handle libraries like mongoose to not cause dependency hell
