design
-tell the user's story (pun intended!)
-mockups









user interfaces editor
-UI components rely on:
--views - visual components
---text view
---button
--viewgroup - visual organisers
--setContentView does the connection between the two
--layout file is the container config - responsible for describing the instantiation of both
---helps model the code as MVC and separate logic from view: controller: java package, view: res package
--component attiributes
---id: unique value for identification, we'll name them according to the activities they originate from(to find them from id)
---layout width/height/center in parent - alligning relative to parent
---text color/style - typography
---text - the actual text that is visualized
--adding elements:
---drag and drop in design view
---code them in text view
--constraining to relative elements - so the default of a floating button won't be a problem
--adding functionality - changing the activity logic
-modern layouts
--buttons
--text views
--images
--fonts
--listview & recycler view
