network design

skills for tablet:

drawing network

>lecture 1:
- drawing the 5 elements
- data flow: no jumping between nodes, the reponse is the reverse nodes order
>lecture 3:
encapsulation and decapsulation in layers:
segment(L4) -> 

PDU encapsulation and decpasulation:
- L4 to L1 header addings:
L4: Data * header4 = segment
L3: Data * header4 * header3 = packet
L2: trailer2 * Data * header4 * header3 * header2 = frame








elements (nodes)

the internet (un-known 
firewall
router
- l3 connecting switches and LANS
- de-encapsulates a packet, and checks where to send it (via it's IP)
switch
- LAN l2 connecting element 
- 24+ RJ 45 interfaces/ports

server
client
- 

















open systems interaction Model
L7:
- apps with internet capability (ie internet browsers)
- HTTP and HTTPS protocols
L6:
- translate app to net format, such as in encryption translation
L5:
- manages communication sessions between local app and remote app (api calls?)
L4:
- breaks down data to small chunks for transport
- establishes E2E communication and process to process communication for applications
L3(router operations):
- connects hosts of different LANs with IP protocol
- provides path selection 
L2(switch operations):
- direct node-to-node connection handling
- error/noise handling
L1: 
- rj45 and optic fibre cable standards
- converting data bits into electrical signals







tcp ip model
- used practacialy, influenced by osi

















transport
- full-duplex : send + recieve + same time
- Straight through cable -> Router/PC To switch 
- Cross Oover cable -> Switch to same, Router/PC To same


transport speed
- metriced by bits and not bytes (unlike in storage)
- IEEE 802.3 standard for RJ45:
-- 10Mbps(ethernet)/100Mbps(fast ethernet) use 4 wires of the RJ45 8
-- 1Gbps(gig ethernet)/10Gbps(10 gig ethernet) use 8 wires of the RJ45 8


transport encapsulation and decapsulation
L4 data combination - segments
L3 data combination - packets













Ethernet Family












out-of-scope (think later where to put these)

RJ45 
- A cable can send + recieve
- copper internet cable has RJ45 connector ends
- ethernet Twisted Pair cabling (UTP cables)
- 100 meter max
-In ethernet/fast ethernet cables:
-- Router, PC, Firewall: 1/2 Tx, 3/6 Rx : Switch is the opposite
-- Switch: 1/2 Rx, 3/6 Tx
-- Most Devices are Auto MDI-X so straight/crossover isn't important

Optic-Fibers:
- A cable can either send OR recieve
- multi mode can reach up to 550 meters, single mode can go 30 km

server acts as forwarding agent

- ipconfig
- ipconfig /all
- ipconfig /displaydns

NestJS RESTful API
- popular for scalable server side applications
- nodejs framework

TCP VS UDP

(ReWrite The following)
TCP: connection oriented protocol 
-> best for high reliability
-> implements three way handshake
- UDP: connectionless protocol-> streaming service
-> DNS 
-> VoIP

PuTTY
- a client-server program, used to remotely access servers, mostly SSHing and Telneting into.
- pscp -P 22 demo-file.zip () <sender part of the CLI command>
- root@<ipadress>:/root

WebSite Inspector:
-console CLI
printing through pop up: alert(hello world)
removes everything and leaves text: document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';
`suppress pasting warning: allow pasting 
-styles:
image inspection: margin in orange, green is padding, and the blue is the element
