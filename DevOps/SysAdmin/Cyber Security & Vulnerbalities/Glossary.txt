- callbacks(calls that are needed for the completion of a process, which is halted until the callback is done)

- calls (API calls)
-- System Calls 
-- HTTP requests
-- signals: I(nter)P(rocess)C(ommunication) callbacks + decouple the local slot(handler) -> thus the slot can be on a different thread. 
--- sigstp, sigcont, sigint etc..
-- system calls: signals while having the slot be the scheduler, though they can also be regular procedures instead of acting parallely.
