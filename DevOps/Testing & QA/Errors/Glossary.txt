Humane (Errors)mistakes make (Faulty)bad code that does not what we wanted(Failure):
- Compilation-Errors: Code doesn't compile  --->  Handled by checked exceptions
- Run-Time-Errors: Compilation went through, though exception was thrown  --->  Handled by un-checked exceptions (not a comp error in java)
- Linking-Errors: Not handled well project linking procedures like pre-proccessors commands
- (Bugs/Defects)Logical-Errors: Code Compiles, not as expected
-- used to handle with return value mechanism, problems:
--- return value not always void (not used)/ an edge case such as C'tor and D'tor
--- only return value? what if we need more information?
--- return value not always checked
