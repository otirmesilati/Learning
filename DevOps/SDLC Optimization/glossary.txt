ci tools
- jenkins
-- running scripts: jobs
--- theres a python library for running jenkins jobs
--- job's build trigger
---- build periodically: based on cron time writing -> started by timer
-- log history available
-- user administration 
-- sharing the environment runnning jobs -> very portable
--- ubuntu : uses linux

-- jenkin pipes
--- groovy









- environments (servers) along the SLDC:
-- local (mostly dev's computers)
-- staging (for testing and demos)
-- production (the product is in customer hands!) -> open netflix.com, that's their production environment

common questions:
- how long does it take to go from one step to the next>
- how long does the whole process take?
- what is slowing us down that i can remove?

or rather transfer it to Design/language skill codex?)

1. Know how to manipulate numbers:
- how to cut digits
- how to add digits

1. UnClear Goals
2. Missed Goals
3. Communication problems
4. Lack of visualization tools:
4.1. Have Visual Tools one the first meet up
4.2. Have The visual tools accesible through out the code desgin process
4.3. Right After Getting done building a pseudo code:
4.3.1. Explain it to yourself, visualise the compilation
4.3.2. try to break the idea down 
5. Help The Developer while they are stuck
6. Each developer takes pseudo code and interperts it his own way:
6.1. though they differ in peudoing and translating their ideas to viable code, they should reach similar end points of Design
6.2 maybe a tool to ease the two proccesses of PSEUDO + TRANSLATE IDEAS?
7. sluggish proedures:
7.1. slow idea transferring
7.2. unclear instructions

Top of the head solutions

 Establishing a communication line (Team chat) 
 Having the team meetup and catch up on further Goals (Daily)
