- environments (servers) along the SLDC:
-- local (mostly dev's computers)
-- staging (for testing and demos)
-- production (the product is in customer hands!) -> open netflix.com, that's their production environment

common questions:
- how long does it take to go from one step to the next>
- how long does the whole process take?
- what is slowing us down that i can remove?









ci
-the process of getting the envrionments to make SLDC efficient
--getting the dev environment ready at morning and shutting it down via scripts at night
---save up the environment costs 
cd
-the deployment of the application









ci tools
- jenkins (one of the defining devops tools)
--enables automation functionality, like python(jobs - scripts proccesses)
---written in bash
--- theres a python library for running jenkins jobs
--- Triggering jobs
---- By time - CRON scheduling
--logs:
--- log history available
----Who ran job?
----When did he run it? how long did it take?
----machine administration can be shared
-----operate on a single node
-----Scripts can be shared
--portable
--Sudden Spike in job demand
---Job Orchestration done in nodes/agents (done by many machines, to deload from one machine the logs, tests..)
----Delagating the workload:
-----Master jenkins server
-----Logs sit on another agent
-----Building the application on another agent
-----Running the python scripts by another agent
-- jenkins pipelines(basically scripts)
--- groovy language
--Environment configurations:
---jenkins can declare environment variables
-circleci
githubactions
gitlab?

(leave this portion here in optimization? 
or rather transfer it to Design/language skill codex?)
^ ^ ^ ^ Arithmatic Code Design Skills ^ ^ ^ ^

1. Know how to manipulate numbers:
- how to cut digits
- how to add digits

1. UnClear Goals
2. Missed Goals
3. Communication problems
4. Lack of visualization tools:
4.1. Have Visual Tools one the first meet up
4.2. Have The visual tools accesible through out the code desgin process
4.3. Right After Getting done building a pseudo code:
4.3.1. Explain it to yourself, visualise the compilation
4.3.2. try to break the idea down 
5. Help The Developer while they are stuck
6. Each developer takes pseudo code and interperts it his own way:
6.1. though they differ in peudoing and translating their ideas to viable code, they should reach similar end points of Design
6.2 maybe a tool to ease the two proccesses of PSEUDO + TRANSLATE IDEAS?
7. sluggish proedures:
7.1. slow idea transferring
7.2. unclear instructions

Top of the head solutions

 Establishing a communication line (Team chat) 
 Having the team meetup and catch up on further Goals (Daily)
