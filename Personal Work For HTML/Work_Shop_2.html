          <em>Every</em> cookie made at the Kevin Cookie company is crafted with
          only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour
          with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs
          from chickens that listen to classical music. Even our water is special.
          It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.
