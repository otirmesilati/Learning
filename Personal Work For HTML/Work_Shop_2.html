      <em>Every</em> cookie made at the Kevin Cookie company is crafted with
      only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour
      with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs
      from chickens that listen to classical music. Even our water is special.
      It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.

    <p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
